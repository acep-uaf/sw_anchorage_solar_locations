### Welcome
This repository contains code and data regarding locations of solar installations in the Anchorage Alaska area between 2017 and 2023. The maps and visuals generated by this repo are intended for public display, either in publications or presentations, and represent a general portrait of the residential solar sector in Anchorage.

#### Address Cleaning Loop
The source data comes from the City of Anchorage Building Permits. The address strings in this source data did not include common nouns (ex: "Street", "Road", "Circle"), which caused errors during the geocode conversion to coordinates. Approximately 160 addresses failed to parse, returning only "Anchorage, AK". These problem addresses were fed into maps.google.com, and the results were written into `address_changes.csv` as `clean_address`. Pre-cleaned addresses were written as `raw_address`. These addresses changes were iterated through in the script `address_extraction_cleaning.R` and the cleaned permit data was written to `clean_2017_2023_SolarPermits.csv`. Addresses only were written to `input_addresses.csv`.

#### API Call
Clean addresses from `input_addresses.csv` were read by the script `api_call.js`, which iterated through each address, pinged Google's Geocode API, caught the response, and wrote the collected responses to a JSON file `api_output.json`. 

#### Output Trimming and CSV Conversion
In order to get the JSON results pared down and converted to CSV, the script `output_to_csv.js` imported `api_output.json`, selected the fields `formatted_address, lat, lng`, then wrote to file `output.csv`. 

#### Joining API output and Permit Data
The flow came full circle via the script `join_output_source.R`, where the output data was loaded from `output.csv` and combined with `clean_2017_2023_SolarPermits.csv`. The combined dataset was written to file as `permits_lat_long.csv`.

#### Conversion Back to GeoJSON
It was useful to have the outputted data in CSV format in order to join back to the source data, but our end product is a web map and it was best to have the data in GeoJSON format. So, a quick script was written, `csv_to_geojson.js` in order to do so. The data was saved as `permits_lat_long.geojson`. Perhaps in the future, this JSON -> CSV -> GeoJSON dance could be eliminated.


#### Heat Map
With the source data combined with location coordinates and saved as a GeoJSON file, we were able to place points on a map and build a heat map of solar installations from 2017 to 2023. An animation of the heat map was added, which loops through the years 2017-2023, advancing 1 year every second. Densities are shown as cumulative installations.
